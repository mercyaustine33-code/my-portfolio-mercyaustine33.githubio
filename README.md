I’m Mercy Bassey Austine, 
a multi-disciplined professional passionate about transforming challenges into opportunities through digital innovation, customer success, and education.

I wear many hats—Educationist, DevOps Engineer, Customer Support Specialist, Instructional Designer, and Digital Skills Coach—but they all align with one vision:

👉 Helping organizations and individuals leverage technology to solve problems, create impact, and unlock opportunities.

For over a decade, I’ve partnered with tech startups, nonprofits, and global clients to design educational programs, streamline customer support, optimize systems, and mentor learners into meaningful remote careers.

🔹 What I Do (Solutions I Provide)
1️⃣ Customer Support Solutions – I help businesses improve CSAT, reduce churn, and build loyalty by setting up ticketing systems (Zendesk, Freshdesk, Gorgias), creating knowledge bases, and training teams in empathetic communication using CRM tools like Salesforce & HubSpot.

2️⃣ DevOps & Technical Infrastructure –
 I streamline deployments, automate workflows, and maintain scalable, secure systems to ensure businesses run smoothly and teams innovate faster.

3️⃣ Instructional Design & Training – I design bite-sized, engaging training (Moodle, Google Classroom) to simplify digital tools for teams and learners, ensuring knowledge retention and practical application.

4️⃣ Digital Skills Coaching – Through Digital Skills Hub, I’ve trained 500+ learners in Virtual Assistance, Customer Support & Remote Productivity. I provide mentorship, accountability, and job referrals—resulting in 70%+ securing remote roles and earning globally.

5️⃣ Community Impact – Through my NGO, Seed of Knowledge Initiative, I lead outreach to underserved children by providing resources, early digital literacy, and educational empowerment.

What Makes Me Different;
I bridge technical expertise + human empathy:

DevOps Engineer → I understand backend systems.

Customer Support Specialist → I connect with users.

Instructional Designer → I make complex topics simple.

Coach → I mentor until results are achieved.
